# Predicting Pizza Prices - Data Analysis Case Study

## Introduction

In this case study, we explore the process of predicting pizza prices using data analysis techniques with Python. The ability to analyze data is a valuable skill for making informed business decisions.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based platform for running Python code and creating Jupyter notebooks.
- **MS Excel**: Used for data preprocessing and initial exploration.
- **Pandas**: A powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Popular plotting library for data visualization.

## Steps

### 1. Data Collection

Gather pizza price data, including information on company, diameter, toppings, variants, size, and other relevant features.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Clean and preprocess data using MS Excel and Pandas. Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and convert data types if needed.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Create visualizations using Matplotlib to gain insights into the distribution of prices, correlations between variables, and other patterns.

### 4. Feature Engineering

Perform feature engineering if necessary, such as encoding categorical variables, scaling features, or creating new features.

### 5. Model Building

Use Python, possibly with Scikit-Learn, to build a predictive model. Linear regression is a common choice for predicting prices.

### 6. Model Evaluation

Assess the model's performance using metrics like R-squared and mean squared error.

### 7. Results and Conclusion

Summarize findings, discuss the predictive capabilities of the model, and highlight insights valuable for decision-making.

## Learning Outcome

By the end of this case study, you'll gain practical experience in data analysis, preprocessing, and predictive modeling, enhancing your skills as a data analyst.

Feel free to adapt and expand on these steps based on the specifics of your data and analysis goals.

Good luck with your study case!
